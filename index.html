                    Born on July 11, 1934, in Italy, Giorgio Armani is an iconic 
                    clothing designer who has expanded his empire to include restaurants 
                    and hotels. His popularity skyrocketed in America in the 1980s when his 
                    men's 'power suits' appeared frequently on the television series Miami Vice 
                    and in the 1980 film American Gigolo, which starred Richard Gere in Armani's 
                    signature garb.

                        Designer Giorgio Armani was born on July 11, 1934, in Piacenza, Italy. 
                        With his body-conscious yet understated clothing, Giorgio Armani has become one 
                        of the most popular names in fashion. He first launched his business empire in the mid-1970s, 
                        and it has grown substantially over the years. The Armani brand now includes makeup, housewares, 
                        books and hotels. The son of a shipping manager, Armani grew up in a small town outside of Milan. 
                        It was a difficult time in Italian history. Giorgio and his two siblings—older brother Sergio and 
                        younger sister Rosanna—experienced the hardships of World War II firsthand. Some of his friends 
                        were killed during Allied bombings. "We were poor and life was tough," he explained to 
                        Harper's Bazaar. "The cinema in Milan was a refuge—a palace of dreams—and the movie stars 
                        seemed so glamorous. I fell in love with the idealized beauty of Hollywood stars."

                            While his designs were popular in Europe, 
                            Armani didn't make a big splash in America until 1980. His clothes were worn by 
                            actor Richard Gere in the film American Gigolo (1980), which helped generate a lot 
                            of interest in Armani. He also provided much of the wardrobe for the hit television 
                            series Miami Vice (1984-89), starring Don Johnson. Soon, many top Hollywood stars started 
                            wearing Armani on the red carpet, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Jodie Foster and John 
                            Travolta, among others.

                            After completing his military service, 
                            Armani dropped out of university and went to work at La Rinascente, 
                            a famous Milan department store. He then joined the staff of Nino Cerruti as a designer. 
                            With the encouragement of his friend Sergio Galeotti, Armani started to do 
                            freelance design work for other companies as well.
                            Armani and Galeotti became business partners, founding Giorgio Armani S.p.A. 
                            in July 1975. The company's first collection—a men's clothing line—debuted 
                            that year. Armani launched a women's collection the following year, which received a
                            warm reception. His clothes were revolutionary at the time, introducing a more natural 
                            fit and using a subtle color palette. "My vision was clear: I believed in getting 
                            rid of the artifice of clothing. I believed in neutral colors," he later told WWD.
