                        Born on July 11, 1934, in Italy, Giorgio Armani is an iconic 
                        clothing designer who has expanded his empire to include restaurants 
                        and hotels. His popularity skyrocketed in America in the 1980s when his 
                        men's 'power suits' appeared frequently on the television series Miami Vice 
                        and in the 1980 film American Gigolo, which starred Richard Gere in Armani's 
                        signature garb.

                    Designer Giorgio Armani was born on July 11, 1934, in Piacenza, Italy. 
                    With his body-conscious yet understated clothing, Giorgio Armani has become one 
                    of the most popular names in fashion. He first launched his business empire in the mid-1970s, 
                    and it has grown substantially over the years. The Armani brand now includes makeup, housewares, 
                    books and hotels. The son of a shipping manager, Armani grew up in a small town outside of Milan. 
                    It was a difficult time in Italian history. Giorgio and his two siblings—older brother Sergio and 
                    younger sister Rosanna—experienced the hardships of World War II firsthand. Some of his friends 
                    were killed during Allied bombings. "We were poor and life was tough," he explained to 
                    Harper's Bazaar. "The cinema in Milan was a refuge—a palace of dreams—and the movie stars 
                    seemed so glamorous. I fell in love with the idealized beauty of Hollywood stars."
