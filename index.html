                        Born on July 11, 1934, in Italy, Giorgio Armani is an iconic 
                        clothing designer who has expanded his empire to include restaurants 
                        and hotels. His popularity skyrocketed in America in the 1980s when his 
                        men's 'power suits' appeared frequently on the television series Miami Vice 
                        and in the 1980 film American Gigolo, which starred Richard Gere in Armani's 
                        signature garb.

                <h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>
                <p>
                    Designer Giorgio Armani was born on July 11, 1934, in Piacenza, Italy. 
                    With his body-conscious yet understated clothing, Giorgio Armani has become one 
                    of the most popular names in fashion. He first launched his business empire in the mid-1970s, 
                    and it has grown substantially over the years. The Armani brand now includes makeup, housewares, 
                    books and hotels. The son of a shipping manager, Armani grew up in a small town outside of Milan. 
                    It was a difficult time in Italian history. Giorgio and his two siblings—older brother Sergio and 
                    younger sister Rosanna—experienced the hardships of World War II firsthand. Some of his friends 
                    were killed during Allied bombings. "We were poor and life was tough," he explained to 
                    Harper's Bazaar. "The cinema in Milan was a refuge—a palace of dreams—and the movie stars 
                    seemed so glamorous. I fell in love with the idealized beauty of Hollywood stars."

                    While his designs were popular in Europe, 
                    Armani didn't make a big splash in America until 1980. His clothes were worn by 
                    actor Richard Gere in the film American Gigolo (1980), which helped generate a lot 
                    of interest in Armani. He also provided much of the wardrobe for the hit television 
                    series Miami Vice (1984-89), starring Don Johnson. Soon, many top Hollywood stars started 
                    wearing Armani on the red carpet, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Jodie Foster and John 
                    Travolta, among others.

                    After completing his military service, 
                    Armani dropped out of university and went to 
                    work at La Rinascente, a famous Milan department store. 
                    He then joined the staff of Nino Cerruti as a designer. 
                    With the encouragement of his friend Sergio Galeotti,
                    Armani started to do freelance design work for other companies as well.

                    freelance design work for other companies as well.
                    Armani and Galeotti became business partners, founding Giorgio Armani S.p.A. 
                    in July 1975. The company's first collection—a men's clothing line—debuted 
                    that year. Armani launched a women's collection the following year, which received a
                    warm reception. His clothes were revolutionary at the time, introducing a more natural 
                    fit and using a subtle color palette. "My vision was clear: I believed in getting 
                    rid of the artifice of clothing. I believed in neutral colors," he later told WWD.
